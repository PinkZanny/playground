"\n"
"        Mean reversion is a financial theory suggesting that asset prices "

"\n"
"        The Mean Reversion Heatmap visualizes the current spread between "
"pairs of cointegrated or correlated assets relative to their historical "
"mean, helping investors identify potential trading opportunities. Colors "

"\n"
"        - **Green**: Spread well below its mean → potential buy\n"
